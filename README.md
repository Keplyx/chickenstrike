There's only one who can take down a squad of terrorists and save the hostages, call him in. All cluck, all chicken.

Inspired by the animation [**Chicken Strike [CS:GO SFM]**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kOOlC058ls) by [Mori Animations](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCHA8dQhAxZ7o8KMy0pNhGtQ)

This plugin tries to reproduce the action as seen on the [Chicken Strike animation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kOOlC058ls), with the permission of the original author, [Mori](http://steamcommunity.com/id/morianimation/) (thanks dude!).
